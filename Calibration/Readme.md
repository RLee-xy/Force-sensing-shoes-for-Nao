Here is the designed apparatus for calibrating the force-sensing shoe, which is saved in the 3D models folder:

To calibrate the shoe, we put different weights on the top of the prutrusions of the shoe to obtain the ground truth CoP position and GRF value and in the same time the sensor readings give us the 
measured CoP position and GRF value. We used a regularized least-squares method to calibrate the optimal load-cell parameters:

The detail can be found in the upcoming paper: Look at me calibrate my new blue force-sensing shoes!
